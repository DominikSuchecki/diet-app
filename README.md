# Diet and Workout Tracker App (The code still needs refactoring. I'm not happy with these large components)

This is my first project in react. It helps you track your diet and workouts. You can use it to:

1. **Calculate your calorie needs**: The app helps you calculate your daily calorie needs based on your age, sex, weight, height, and activity level.
2. **Calculate the energy expenditure of activities**: You can enter data about your workouts, and the app will calculate how many calories you burned during each activity.
3. **Keep a food diary**: You can track your meals and snacks, and the app will calculate their calorie content and macronutrients.
4. **Add workout notes**: You can add notes to your workouts to track your progress and observe changes.

## Technologies

The app is built on the following technologies:
- **Frontend**: React
- **UI**: MDBootstrap
- **Backend**: Laravel API

Libraries used:
- `react-router-dom`
